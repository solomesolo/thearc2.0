            <h3>Your core systems destabilise</h3>
            <p>
              Sustained cognitive and emotional pressure elevates baseline stress physiology. Patterns indicate reduced recovery capacity across the workweek. Irregular routines impact sleep depth and circadian rhythm stability.

            <h3>Care resets every time pressure increases</h3>
            <p>
              Workload, stress hormones, and cognitive load can reduce sleep quality without affecting duration. No structured approach to managing biological stress load. Preventative health schedules collapse under work pressure.

            <p>
              Modern work demands expose a system designed for traditional schedules. Symptoms get treated, not underlying patterns. Your biological data remains invisible without proper assessment. It's not your discipline — it's outdated infrastructure.
